# random-picker-sharp
A very niche and specific tool I made to automate a type of game some friends and I play.

### Why?
My friends sometimes play a game where people will contribute songs, or really anything that can be found on a URL, and someone has to guess who's the one who put it in. This program is to automate the process.

### Seriously?
Yes, but it kept me busy for an afternoon.

### Why the name?
Originally I hacked together a really quick version on Python on the spot, but decided to rewrite it in C#.
